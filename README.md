# Domains For Hackers. By Hackers

This project does domain service on a Polygon L2. It comes with a simple contract(which is what I initially thought), a test for that contract(that I might never get around to keeping up-to-date), and a script that deploys that contract(coz who does all this work on their own when we have computers).

Try buying some domains, you!
